#! While structure:

#` 1. The while statement starts with the while keyword, followed bu a test condition, and ends with a colon (:).
#` 2. The loop body contains the code that gets repeated at each step of the loop. Each line is indented four spaces.

#$ Example:
n = 10
while n < 20:
    print(n)
    n = n + 1

#. infinite loop
while n <= 10:
    print(n)
